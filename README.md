# Duolingo

**Unofficial** library for interacting with the Duolingo APIs.

This project is forked from https://github.com/KartikTalwar/Duolingo, which appears to be abandoned. I forked the project because of recent changes by Duolingo to their APIs have broken that copy of the library. I have pared down some functionality to just the most useful and most tested features of that original library.

## Disclaimer

I barely use this library myself. Accordingly:

  * This project is not published to PyPi. You can't install it using `pip`. I use this library for a personal project that doesn't involve downloading requirements from PyPi, and don't want the responsibility of publishing it there.
  * It takes me a long time to spin up on merge requests. Expect a month or more for a response and six months or more for resolution.
  * My focus is on maintaining the existing functionality of this library: I will probably not accept requests for new features, and may or may not accept merge requests with new features.

If you've got a more intensive use case for this library, I would encourage you to fork it and I'd be glad to hand over ownership!

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, standby for contributing instructions. Feel free to open up an issue in the mean time. If you'd like to contribute intensively, consider taking on ownership of the library as an alternative.
